5. **Edge Case Testing**: Handling null values, empty strings, invalid inputs
6. **Mocking Strategy**: Using Mockito for service dependencies and external integrations
7. **Data Integrity**: Verifying entity relationships and data consistency
8. **Reactive Testing**: Using StepVerifier for reactive stream testing

### Test Categories Covered
- **Unit Tests**: Testing individual components in isolation
- **Integration Tests**: Testing component interactions
- **Business Logic Tests**: Validating business rules and constraints
- **Error Handling Tests**: Ensuring proper exception handling
- **Data Validation Tests**: Verifying data integrity and constraints

- **Reactive Tests**: Testing streaming responses

## Business Logic Coverage

### Critical Business Rules Tested
1. **24-Hour Change Rule**: Bookings cannot be changed within 24 hours of departure
2. **48-Hour Cancellation Rule**: Bookings cannot be cancelled within 48 hours of departure
3. **Case-Insensitive Search**: Booking lookup works regardless of case sensitivity
4. **Data Validation**: All booking operations validate required fields
5. **Demo Data Generation**: Service initializes with 5 sample bookings
6. **Chat Memory**: Conversation context preservation across requests
7. **Streaming Responses**: Real-time chat response handling

## Metrics and Statistics
